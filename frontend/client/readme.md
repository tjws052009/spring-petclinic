# Spring PetClinic Application Frontend React Web Application

The frontend is composed of a React web application and a node.js Express application acting as a proxy for the React web application. This the *React* web application.

Keep in mind that you will have to properly configure the APM agents accordingly using your APM server URL etc. to have APM data sent to Elastic APM correctly.
